                <h1>Paul Newman</h1>
                <p class="paul_p"><strong>Paul Leonard Newman</strong> (January 26, 1925 – September 26, 2008) was an American actor, film director, racing car driver, philanthropist, and entrepreneur. He was the recipient of <a href="">numerous awards</a>, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Silver Bear for Best Actor, a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, and nominations for two Grammy Awards and a Tony Award. Along with his Best Actor Academy Award win, Newman also received the Academy Honorary Award and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.</p>
                <p class="paul_p">Born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and raised in Shaker Heights, the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, Newman showed an interest in theater as a child and at age 10 performed in a stage production of Saint George and the Dragon at the Cleveland Play House. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics from Kenyon College in 1949. After touring with several summer stock companies including the Belfry Players, Newman attended the Yale School of Drama for a year before studying at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. His first starring Broadway role was in William Inge's Picnic in 1953 and his final was in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town in 2003.</p>
                <p class="paul_p">Newman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in The Color of Money (1986). His other Oscar-nominated performances were in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963), Cool Hand Luke (1967), Absence of Malice (1981), The Verdict (1982), Nobody's Fool (1994), and Road to Perdition (2002). He also starred in such films as Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), The Long, Hot Summer (1958), Harper (1966), Torn Curtain (1966), Hombre (1967), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), The Sting (1973), The Towering Inferno (1974), Slap Shot (1977), and Fort Apache, The Bronx (1981).

                    <p>He made his Broadway theatre debut in the original production of William Inge's Picnic with Kim Stanley in 1953. While working on the production, he met Joanne Woodward, an understudy. The two married in 1958. He also appeared in the original Broadway production of The Desperate Hours in 1955. In 1959, he was in the original Broadway production of Sweet Bird of Youth with Geraldine Page and three years later starred with Page in the film version. During this time Newman started acting in television. His first credited role was in a 1952 episode of Tales of Tomorrow entitled "Ice from Space".[29] In the mid-1950s, he appeared twice on CBS's Appointment with Adventure anthology series.</p>
                    <p>In February 1954, Newman appeared in a screen test with James Dean, directed by Gjon Mili, for East of Eden (1955). Newman was tested for the role of Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron's twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to Richard Davalos. That same year, as a last-minute replacement for Dean, he co-starred with Eva Marie Saint and Frank Sinatra in a live, color television broadcast of Our Town, which was a musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder's stage play.[30] After Dean's death, Newman replaced Dean in the role of a boxer in a television adaptation of Hemingway's story "The Battler", written by A. E. Hotchner, that was broadcast live on October 18, 1955. That performance led to his breakthrough role as Rocky Graziano in the film Somebody Up There Likes Me in 1956.[31] The Dean connection had additional resonance. Newman was cast as Billy the Kid in The Left Handed Gun, which was a role originally earmarked for Dean. Additionally, Dean was originally cast to play the role of Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me; however, with his death, Newman got the role.[32][33]</p>
                    <p>Newman's first film for Hollywood was The Silver Chalice (1954), co-starring Italian actress Pier Angeli. The film was a box-office failure, and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it.[34] In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise's biographical film Somebody Up There Likes Me.[35] That year, he also played the lead in Arnold Laven's The Rack.[36] In 1957, Newman worked again with director Wise in Until They Sail.[37] Also that year, he acted in Michael Curtiz's The Helen Morgan Story.[38]</p>

                    <p>In 1958, he starred in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box-office smash, and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in The Long, Hot Summer with his future wife Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film. He and Woodward had also appeared on screen earlier in 1958 in the Playhouse 90 television play The 80 Yard Run.[39] The couple would go on to make a total of 16 films together.</p>
                    <p>In 1959, Newman starred in The Young Philadelphians, a film that also featured Barbara Rush, Robert Vaughn and Alexis Smith and was directed by Vincent Sherman.[41] He also co-starred with Woodward in the film Rally Round the Flag, Boys!.[42] In 1960, he starred in Exodus[43] and co-starred with Woodward in From the Terrace.</p>
                    <p>In 1961, Newman starred in Robert Rossen's The Hustler. The film, which was based on a book of the same name by Walter Tevis, tells the story of small-time pool hustler "Fast Eddie" Felson (Newman) who challenges a legendary pool player portrayed by Jackie Gleason. The film was a critical and financial hit. Newman won both the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award and the Argentinian Film Festival Best Actor awards. He was also nominated for the same prize at that year's Academy Awards.[45] Stanley Kauffmann, writing for The New Republic, praised the principal cast, calling Newman "first-rate".</p>
                    <p>In 1975, Redford's hit movies included a 1920s aviation drama, <i>The Great Waldo Pepper</i> (1975) and the spy thriller <i>Three Days of the Condor</i> (1975), alongside Faye Dunaway, which finished 16th and 17th in box-office grosses for 1975, respectively. In 1976, he co-starred with Dustin Hoffman in the 2nd-highest-grossing film for the year, the critically acclaimed <i>All the President's Men</i>. In 1976, Redford published <i>The Outlaw Trail: A Journey Through Time</i>. Redford stated, "The Outlaw Trail. It was a name that fascinated me—a geographical anchor in Western folklore. Whether real or imagined, it was a name that, for me, held a kind of magic, a freedom, a mystery. I wanted to see it in much the same way as the outlaws did, by horse and by foot and document the adventure with text and photographs."</p>
                    <p>Also that year, Newman co-starred with Woodward in Paris Blues. In 1963, Newman starred in Hud and co-starred with Woodward in A New Kind of Love. In 1966, he starred in Torn Curtain and Harper.</p>

                    <p>In 1980, Newman directed the television screen version of the Pulitzer Prize–winning play The Shadow Box. In 1981, he acted in Sydney Pollack's Absence of Malice.[87] He starred in Sidney Lumet's The Verdict in 1982. The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, and Newman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.[88] In 1984, Newman starred in and directed Harry & Son.</p>
                    <p>In 1986, twenty-five years after The Hustler, Newman reprised his role of "Fast Eddie" Felson in the Martin Scorsese–directed film The Color of Money,[89] for which he finally received the Academy Award for Best Actor.[90] The film was a commercial success although it received mixed reviews. Newman starred with Tom Cruise, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and John Turturro.</p>
                    <p>In mid-1987, Newman sued Universal Pictures for allegedly failing to account properly for revenues from video distribution of four of his films made for Universal and that Universal owed him at least $1 million for the home video versions of The Sting, Slap Shot, Winning, and Sometimes a Great Notion. The complaint claimed that Universal accounted for the cassette revenues in a way that improperly decreased amounts due to Newman, with the actor wanting a full accounting along with $2 million in damages.</p>
                    <p>Also in 1987, Newman directed a screen version of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie starring his wife Joanne Woodward, John Malkovich, and Karen Allen.[92] The film was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.[93] Variety called it "a reverent record" of the Williams play that "one watches with a kind of distant dreaminess rather than an intense emotional involvement" and cited the "brilliant performances ... well defined by Newman's direction".</p>
                    <p>In 1990, Newman co-starred with Woodward in the James Ivory film adaptation Mr. and Mrs. Bridge based on the Evan S. Connell novel of the same name. In 1994, Newman played alongside Tim Robbins as the character Sidney J. Mussburger in the Coen brothers comedy The Hudsucker Proxy, which received mixed reviews.[95] Also that year, he acted in Robert Benton's Nobody's Fool earning yet another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p>

                  <div class="years">
                    <p>In 2003, Newman appeared in a Broadway revival of Wilder's Our Town, winning a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance. PBS and the cable network Showtime aired a taping of the production, and Newman was nominated for an Emmy Award as well[97] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie. Newman's last live-action movie appearance was as a conflicted mob boss in the Sam Mendes-directed film Road to Perdition (2002) opposite Tom Hanks, Jude Law, and Stanley Tucci. For his performance he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
                    <p>Although he continued to provide voice work for movies, Newman's last live-action appearance was in the 2005 HBO mini-series Empire Falls, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Richard Russo), in which he played the dissolute father of the protagonist Miles Roby and for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with his strong interest in auto racing, Newman provided the voice of Doc Hudson, a retired anthropomorphic race car, in Cars (2006). This was his final role in a major feature film as well as his only animated film role. Almost nine years after his death, he was billed as Doc Hudson in Cars 3 (2017), his appearance made possible through the use of archival recordings. Newman retired from acting in May 2007, saying: "You start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that's pretty much a closed book for me."[98] He came out of retirement to record narration for the 2007 documentary Dale about the life of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt and for the 2008 documentary The Meerkats, his final film role overall.</p>

                <p>In a 2011 interview, screenwriter Stewart Stern recounted that Newman drew on an incident from his Navy years as an "emotional trigger to express the character's trauma" when acting in the 1956 film The Rack. He said that Newman thought back to an incident in which his best friend was sliced to pieces on an aircraft carrier by a plane's propeller.</p>
