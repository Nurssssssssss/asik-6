                    <p><b>Charles Robert Redford Jr.</b><br> (August 18, 1936 ‚Äì September 16, 2025) was an acclaimed American actor, director and producer, celebrated for his magnetic presence as a leading man during the American New Wave. Across a career spanning more than six decades, Redford earned widespread recognition and numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award and five Golden Globe Awards, highlighted by the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1994. Beyond competitive honors, he was widely celebrated for his contributions to film and culture, receiving the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1996, the Academy Honorary Award in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2005, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the Honorary C√©sar in 2019. Redford‚Äôs enduring legacy encompasses his artistic achievements, visionary filmmaking, and lasting impact on American cinema.</p>
                    <p>Redford began his career on television in the late 1950s, appearing in anthology series such as <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> and <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. He made his Broadway debut in Neil Simon's comedy <i>Barefoot in the Park</i> (1963) before taking film roles in <i>War Hunt</i> (1962) and <i>Inside Daisy Clover</i> (1965). He then achieved Hollywood stardom with <i>Barefoot in the Park</i> (1967), <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> (1969), <i>Downhill Racer</i> (1969), <i>Jeremiah Johnson</i> (1972), <i>The Candidate</i> (1972) and <i>The Sting</i> (1973), with the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination.</p>
                    <p>His stardom continued with films such as <i>The Way We Were</i> (1973), <i>The Great Gatsby</i> (1974), <i>Three Days of the Condor</i> (1975), <i>All the President's Men</i> (1976), <i>The Electric Horseman</i> (1979), <i>The Natural</i> (1984) and <i>Out of Africa</i> (1985). Later credits include <i>Sneakers</i> (1992), <i>Indecent Proposal</i> (1993), <i>All Is Lost</i> (2013), <i>Truth</i> (2015), <i>Our Souls at Night</i> (2017) and <i>The Old Man & the Gun</i> (2018). He also played Alexander Pierce in the MCU films <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i> (2014) and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> (2019), the latter serving as his final on-screen role.</p>
                    <p>Redford made his directorial debut with the family drama <i>Ordinary People</i> (1980), which won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. His later directing credits include <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i> (1988), <i>A River Runs Through It</i> (1992), <i>Quiz Show</i> (1994), <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> (1998) and <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> (2000). A major advocate for independent cinema, Redford co-founded the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival in 1978, helping to foster a new generation of filmmakers. Beyond his artistic career, he was noted for his environmental activism, his support of Native American and Indigenous rights and his advocacy for LGBTQ equality.</p>

                    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                    <p>Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California, to Martha Woodruff Redford (n√©e Hart; 1914‚Äì1955), who was from Austin, Texas and Charles Robert Redford Sr. (1914‚Äì1991), an accountant. He had a paternal half-brother, William. Redford was of Irish, Scottish and English ancestry. His patrilineal great-great-grandfather, a Protestant Englishman named Elisha Redford, married Mary Ann McCreery, of Irish Catholic descent, in Manchester, Lancashire. They immigrated to New York City in America in 1849, immediately settling next in Stonington, Connecticut. They had a son named Charles, the first in line to have been given the name. Regarding Redford's maternal lineage, the Harts were Irish from Galway and the Greens were Scotch-Irish who settled in the United States in the 18th century. Redford's family lived in Van Nuys while his father worked in El Segundo. As a child, he and his family often traveled to Austin to visit his maternal grandfather. Redford credited his environmentalism and love of nature to his childhood in Texas.</p>
                    <p>Redford attended Van Nuys High School, where he was classmates with baseball pitcher Don Drysdale. He described himself as having been a "bad" student, finding inspiration outside the classroom in art and sports. He hit tennis balls with Pancho Gonzalez at the Los Angeles Tennis Club to help Gonzalez warm up for matches. Redford had a mild case of polio when he was 11.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from high school in 1954, he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder for a year and a half, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. While there, he worked at a restaurant/bar called The Sink, where a painting of his likeness now figures prominently among the bar's murals. While at Colorado, Redford began drinking heavily and, as a result, lost his half-scholarship and was expelled from school. He went on to travel in Europe, living in France, Spain and Italy. He later studied painting at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York and took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Class of 1959) in Manhattan, New York.</p>

                        <p>Redford's acting career began in New York City, where he worked both on stage and in television. His Broadway debut was in a small role in <i>Tall Story</i> (1959), followed by parts in <i>The Highest Tree</i> (1959) and <i>Sunday in New York</i> (1961). His biggest success on Broadway was as the stuffy newlywed husband of Elizabeth Ashley in the original 1963 cast of Neil Simon's <i>Barefoot in the Park</i>. Starting in 1960, Redford appeared as a guest star on numerous television drama programs, including <i>Naked City</i>, <i>Maverick</i>, <i>The Untouchables</i>, <i>The Americans</i>, <i>Whispering Smith</i>, <i>Perry Mason</i>, <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, <i>Route 66</i>, <i>Dr. Kildare</i>, <i>Playhouse 90</i>, <i>Tate</i>, <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, <i>The Virginian</i> and <i>Captain Brassbound's Conversion</i>, among others.</p>
                        <p>Redford made his screen debut in the film adaptation of <i>Tall Story</i> (1960), reprising his Broadway role, although he was not credited. The film's stars were Anthony Perkins, Jane Fonda and Ray Walston. After his Broadway success, he was cast in larger feature roles in movies. In 1960, Redford was cast as Danny Tilford, a mentally disturbed young man trapped in the wreckage of his family garage, in "Breakdown", one of the last episodes of the syndicated adventure series <i>Rescue 8</i>, starring Jim Davis and Lang Jeffries. Redford earned an Emmy nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in <i>The Voice of Charlie Pont</i> (ABC, 1962). One of his last television appearances until 2019 was on October 7, 1963, on <i>Breaking Point</i>, an ABC medical drama about psychiatry.</p>
                        <p>In 1962, Redford received his second film role in <i>War Hunt</i>, and was cast soon after alongside screen legend Alec Guinness in the war comedy <i>Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious</i>, in which he played a U.S. soldier falsely imprisoned by a German civilian even after the war had ended. In <i>Inside Daisy Clover</i> (1965), which won him a Golden Globe for best new star, he played a bisexual movie star who marries starlet Natalie Wood and rejoined her along with Charles Bronson for Sydney Pollack's <i>This Property Is Condemned</i> (1966)‚Äîagain, as her lover, though this time in a film which achieved even greater success. The same year saw his first teaming (on equal footing) with Jane Fonda, in Arthur Penn's <i>The Chase</i> (1966 film). The film marked the only time Redford starred with Marlon Brando.</p>

                    <div class="years">
                        <p>Fonda and Redford were paired again in the popular big-screen version of <i>Barefoot in the Park</i> (1967) and were again co-stars a dozen years later in Pollack's <i>The Electric Horseman</i> (1979), followed 38 years later with a Netflix feature, <i>Our Souls at Night</i>. After this initial success, Redford became concerned about his blond male stereotype image and refused roles in <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> and <i>The Graduate</i>. Redford found the niche he was seeking in George Roy Hill's <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> (1969), scripted by William Goldman, in which he was paired for the first time with Paul Newman. The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star, cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy.</p>
                        <p>While Redford did not receive an Academy Award or Golden Globe nomination for playing the Sundance Kid, he won a British Academy of Film and Television Award (BAFTA) for that role and his parts in <i>Downhill Racer</i> (1969) and <i>Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here</i> (1969). The latter two films and the subsequent <i>Little Fauss and Big Halsy</i> (1970) and <i>The Hot Rock</i> (1972) were not commercially successful. Redford had long harbored ambitions to work on both sides of the camera. As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for <i>Downhill Racer</i>. The political satire <i>The Candidate</i> (1972) was a moderate box-office and critical success.</p>
                        <p>Starting in 1973, Redford experienced a four-year run of box-office successes. The western <i>Jeremiah Johnson</i>'s (1972) box-office earnings from early 1973 until its second re-release in 1975 would have placed it as the 2nd-highest-grossing film of 1973. His romantic period drama with Barbra Streisand, <i>The Way We Were</i> (1973), was the 5th-highest-grossing film of 1973. The crime caper reunion with Paul Newman, <i>The Sting</i> (1973), became the top-grossing film of 1974 and one of the top-twenty highest-grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation and it also landed Redford the lone nomination of his career for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he starred in the romantic drama <i>The Great Gatsby</i> (1974), also starring Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston and Bruce Dern. The film was the 8th-highest-grossing film of 1974. <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> (1969) placed as the 10th-highest-grossing film for 1974, as it was re-released due to the popularity of <i>The Sting</i>. In 1974, Redford became the first performer since Bing Crosby in 1946 to have three films in a year's top-ten-grossing titles. Each year between 1974 and 1976, movie exhibitors voted Redford Hollywood's top box-office star.</p>
                        <p>In 1975, Redford's hit movies included a 1920s aviation drama, <i>The Great Waldo Pepper</i> (1975) and the spy thriller <i>Three Days of the Condor</i> (1975), alongside Faye Dunaway, which finished 16th and 17th in box-office grosses for 1975, respectively. In 1976, he co-starred with Dustin Hoffman in the 2nd-highest-grossing film for the year, the critically acclaimed <i>All the President's Men</i>. In 1976, Redford published <i>The Outlaw Trail: A Journey Through Time</i>. Redford stated, "The Outlaw Trail. It was a name that fascinated me‚Äîa geographical anchor in Western folklore. Whether real or imagined, it was a name that, for me, held a kind of magic, a freedom, a mystery. I wanted to see it in much the same way as the outlaws did, by horse and by foot and document the adventure with text and photographs."</p>
                        <p><i>All the President's Men</i>, in which Redford and Hoffman play Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, was a landmark film for Redford. Not only was he the executive producer and co-star, but the film's serious subject matter‚Äîthe Watergate scandal‚Äîand its attempt to create a realistic portrayal of journalism also reflected the actor's offscreen concerns for political causes. The film landed eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director (Alan J. Pakula), while winning for the Best Screenplay (Goldman). It won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Picture and Best Director. In 1977, Redford appeared in a segment of the war film <i>A Bridge Too Far</i> (1977). He took a two-year hiatus from movies before starring as a past-his-prime rodeo star in the adventure-romance <i>The Electric Horseman</i> (1979). This film reunited him with Fonda, finishing at No. 9 at the box office in 1980.</p>

                    <div class="years">
                        <p>Redford's first film as director was the drama film <i>Ordinary People</i> (1980), a drama about the slow disintegration of an upper-middle class family after the death of a son. Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful, dramatic performance from Mary Tyler Moore, as well as superb work from Donald Sutherland and Timothy Hutton, who also won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film is one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Redford himself and Best Picture. Critic Roger Ebert declared it "an intelligent, perceptive and deeply moving film." Later that year he appeared in the prison drama <i>Brubaker</i> (1980), playing a prison warden attempting to reform the system.</p>
                        <p>Soon afterwards, he starred in the baseball drama <i>The Natural</i> (1984). Sydney Pollack's <i>Out of Africa</i> (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite Meryl Streep, became a large box office success (combined 1985 and 1986 grosses placed it at No. 5 for 1986), won a Golden Globe for Best Picture, and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture. Streep was nominated for Best Actress, but Redford did not receive a nomination. The movie proved to be Redford's biggest success of the decade and Redford and Pollack's most successful of their seven movies together. Redford's next film, <i>Legal Eagles</i> (1986) alongside Debra Winger, was only a minor success at the box office.</p>
                        <p>Redford did not direct again until <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i> (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of John Nichols's acclaimed novel of the Southwest. <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i> is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of Truchas in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out with tax increases.</p>
                        <p>Redford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 1992, he released his third film as a director, the period drama <i>A River Runs Through It</i>, based on Norman Maclean's novella, starring Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt and Tom Skerritt. Redford received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. This was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young Pitt to greater prominence. In 1994, he directed the expos√© <i>Quiz Show</i> about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s. In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by Paul Attanasio with cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and a cast that featured Paul Scofield, John Turturro, Rob Morrow and Ralph Fiennes. David Ansen of <i>Newsweek</i> wrote, "Robert Redford may have become a more complacent movie star in the last decade, but he has become a more daring and accomplished filmmaker. 'Quiz Show' is his best movie since 'Ordinary People'."</p>
                        <p>In 1993, he starred in <i>Indecent Proposal</i> as a billionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with Michelle Pfeiffer in the newsroom romance <i>Up Close & Personal</i> (1996), and with Kristin Scott Thomas and a young Scarlett Johansson in <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> (1998), which he also directed. Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as <i>Havana</i> (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as <i>Sneakers</i> (1992), in which he co-starred with River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier.</p>

                    <div class="years">
                        <p>Redford also directed Matt Damon and Will Smith in <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> (2000). He appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama <i>The Last Castle</i> (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with Pitt for <i>Spy Game</i>, another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of <i>The Candidate</i> but the project never happened. Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary <i>Sacred Planet</i> (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In <i>The Clearing</i> (2004), Redford portrayed Wayne Hayes, a shrewd businessman whose kidnapping forces him and his wife to confront the personal compromises behind their seemingly ideal life.</p>
                        <p>Redford stepped back into producing with <i>The Motorcycle Diaries</i> (2004), a coming-of-age road film about Ernesto "Che" Guevara as a young medical student and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future. With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released. Back in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director Lasse Hallstr√∂m's <i>An Unfinished Life</i> (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who takes in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez) and the granddaughter he never knew, after they flee an abusive relationship.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with Streep, 22 years after they starred in <i>Out of Africa</i>, for his personal project <i>Lions for Lambs</i> (2007), which also starred Tom Cruise. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office. Owen Gleiberman of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote, "<i>Lions for Lambs</i> is so square it's like something out of the gray twilight glow of the golden age of television. Even the military plot, which clunks, seems to be taking place on stage." In 2010, Redford released <i>The Conspirator</i>, a period drama revolving around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Redford appeared in the 2011 documentary <i>Buck</i> by Cindy Meehl, where he discussed his experiences with title subject Buck Brannaman during the production of <i>The Horse Whisperer</i>. In 2012, Redford directed <i>The Company You Keep</i>, in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. The film starred himself, Shia LaBeouf and Julie Christie.</p>

                    <div class="years">
                        <p>In 2013, Redford starred in <i>All Is Lost</i>, directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he was its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, his first time winning an acting honor from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for <i>Downhill Racer</i>). Ali Arikan wrote in <i>RogerEbert.com</i>, "Chandor plays to Redford's strengths: his battered visage, calm determination and detachment from the vagaries of a 'normal' existence. In return, Redford gives the performance of the latter half of his career in a role that is not just physically, but also psychologically demanding".</p>
                        <p>In April 2014, Redford played the main antagonist of the Marvel Studios superhero film <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>, Alexander Pierce, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and leader of the Hydra cell operating the Triskelion. Redford was a co-producer and, with Emma Thompson and Nick Nolte, acted in the film <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> (2015), based on Bill Bryson's book of the same name. Redford had optioned the film rights for the book from Bryson after reading it more than a decade earlier, with the intent of co-starring in it with Paul Newman, but had shelved the project after Newman's death.</p>
                        <p>Also in 2015, he played news anchor Dan Rather in James Vanderbilt's <i>Truth</i> alongside Cate Blanchett. The film received mixed reviews with Justin Chang of <i>Variety</i> noting, "Redford, who bears a solid resemblance to Rather but not quite enough to make you forget whom you're watching, plays the veteran newsman with easy gravitas, inner strength and a gentle paternal twinkle, with little display of the anger and volatility for which he was often known over the course of his storied career." In 2016, he took the supporting role of Mr. Meacham in the Disney remake <i>Pete's Dragon</i>. The next year, Redford starred in <i>The Discovery</i> and <i>Our Souls at Night</i>, both released on Netflix streaming in 2017. The latter film, which he also produced, reunited him with Fonda for the fifth time and garnered positive reviews.</p>
                        <p>Redford played bank robber Forrest Tucker in the David Lowery‚Äìdirected drama film <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i>, which was released in September 2018 and for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. Alissa Wikinson wrote in <i>Vox</i>, "In <i>The Old Man &amp; the Gun</i>, both Redford and Lowery are returning to their roots. For Redford, a role as a lifelong bank robber feels like a fitting cap to a career effectively launched half a century ago with his role alongside Paul Newman in <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>." In August 2018, Redford announced his retirement from acting after completion of the film, though the following month, Redford stated that he "regretted" announcing his retirement because "you never know".</p>
                        <p>Redford briefly reprised his role as Alexander Pierce with a cameo in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, filmed in 2017 before the completion of the former film. Redford, an executive producer of the series <i>Dark Winds</i>, made a cameo alongside fellow executive producer George R. R. Martin portraying a detainee playing chess.</p>
